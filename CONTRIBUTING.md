#Contribute To Redux Framework

Redux exists for our community. As such, community made patches, bug reports and contributions are more than welcome! Besides that, they are crucial to ensure the stability and future of Redux.

If you have a contribution, please ensure you follow the guidelines below.

## Getting Started

* Submit a ticket for your issue or comment on a pre-existing one.
  * Post on our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/ghost1227/Redux-Framework/issues).

  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue as well as the version of WordPress you are using.

## Making Changes

* If possible, and applicable, please add/update unit tests for your changes.

## Code Documentation

* We endeavour to ensure that Redux is fully documented and follows the standards set by phpDoc.
* An example function can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/ghost1227/6332195).

    * If you are adding/editing a function in a class, make sure to add `@access {private|public|protected}`.
